Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

To run this program you type "make run" in the shell. You will get a menu of
options you can pick. If you type 'a' you can enter a string and it will be
tokenized automatically. If you type b you will get a new history menu. Within
this menu if you type 'a' it will print the entire history. If you just want
to print the string at a specific id then you type '!' followed by the number
you want to print. This will loop until you type 'q'. At this point the
program will end.
